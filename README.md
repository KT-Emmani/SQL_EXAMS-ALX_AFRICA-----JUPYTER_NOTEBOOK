# SQL_EXAMS-ALX_AFRICA-----JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK
This is a Jupyter Notebook documenting all my SQL queries as I prepare for my SQL exams after completing the 3rd Sprint (Querying Data Module) of Data Analytics Program at ALX Africa.

This projeect seeks to challenge students to determine how much they have learned so far and test their knowledge on SQL by exploring The Movie Database - TMDb. 

## The TMDb database
The Movie Database â€“ an online movie and TV show database that houses some of the most popular movies and TV shows at your fingertips. The TMDb database supports 39 official languages used in over 180 countries daily and dates back all the way to 2008.
